## AMDABTM - All my data are belong to me

Collect your data from the data collectors

This project tries to collect the users own data that all the data collecting comanies in the web collect. Like Amazon, Google, Netflix, LastFM and many more internet companies collect data of you. That doesn't have to be generally bad. The goal of AMDABTM is to create filters to parse the data of those companies and display them in a nice and pretty way.
